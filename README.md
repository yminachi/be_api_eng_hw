# Explanation of changes / thought process

- Decided to split models.py, views.py, tests.py, and serializers.py into separate files by model for readability. I could have used separate django apps for this, but for this limited sample, it didn't seem like there was enough to justify it.
- I chose to rest_framework's generic API views instead of ModelViewSets, or GenericViewSets + Model Mixins, because that's what the example was already using and it suited the needs of the project.
- For auditing, I chose to just run a simple helper method in the views themselves. I think if this were a real large-scale project where we needed to audit every action on every model, I would experiment with something a little more generic that wouldn't require putting a log line in every view, such as a signal or a viewset base class or something. With the limited time I went with the simple solution.
- Unfortunately, I did not have the time to impliment the bonus features.

## How to run

- `python manage.py migrate`
- `python manage.py tests` - test should all pass
- `python manage.py runserver`
- New endpoints are:
  - /login/ - pass in a username and password and get a token
  - /audit/ - list only, requires staff login
  - /users/ - list, create, retrieve, and destroy

# Backend Engineering Homework

Thank you for spending time with us in the previous interviews. The next step in the process is a homework assignment designed to help us understand how you handle actual coding problems. We would like you to do this assignment, taking a maximum of 4 hours so we donâ€™t eat up too much of your time. Make sure to understand your solution as the next step in the process is deep diving on it.

### Part 1: Get it working

Since this is a vanilla Django Rest Framework application we will not be providing instructions on how to get it up and running. Additionally, there are issues with the application which you will need to find and fix before you can move onto part two. The application needs to be functional when turned in.

### Part 2: Managing users

Currently, our application doesn't allow users to be added or deleted through the API.

- Only staff users should be able to do this
- If someone deletes a user it should "soft delete", so instead of removing the record from the database it should simply be flagged as deleted.
- If a user is deleted it should be filtered from all views of any non-staff user
- If the user is staff the app should optionally display deleted users when they specify a flag to the api endpoint
- Make sure the user is able to be interacted with in the Django admin.
- This system needs to have tests.

### Part 3: Audit Log

We are interested in seeing what was done in the system. To this end we would like you to add a new feature which will store all API actions and allow us to view them through another API endpoint.

Requirements for the model:

- The action should be stored in the database
- It should have the user attached
- The model should record the model name, id, action taken (update, create, destroy), and timestamp
- Should only be visible to Staff. No one should be able to add or edit through the API
- Add the model to the django admin
- Tests should be included

### Part 4: Authenticaion

We need to make sure people can use our API programmatically so we need to make sure the API will accept tokens.

- Ensure that the API can accept both django login as well as token login
- The API needs to have the urls set up for the token retrieval

### Bonus: Still have time?

If you finish the above and still have time within the given 4 hours here are some bonus tasks to show off a bit.

- Add tests for the rest of the system beyond what you created.
- A static token isn't the most secure way to interact with our api. Show us what you can do with other options like JWT or OAuth.

## Deliverables

We would like you to create your own repo that has the finished homework assignment. Please include documentation on anything we need to know to set it up and any notes you have for the team.

## Questions?

We are happy to answer questions. Just reach out to your recruiter to get in touch.
